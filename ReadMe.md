# Metadata Editor Dockerized

This Metadata Editor is based on a D3 SVG tree graphic, using a local json file as the User interface schema to build the nodes. Also included in the json file are reference attributes for populating values with data imported from external api calls that return json.  The intent is for this editor to work with multiple UI json schemas and to easily adapt to variety of metadata standards, formats and sources.  The source json object is preserved locally, and once the edits have been completed the intent is with an export schema, to map the Json object back to the source structure and post it back to its original repository.

The transform function iterates through a provided schema, and looks up all reference attribute values from the source json, returning a json object that has the structure of the provided schema populated with data from the source json. This allows the same transform functions to be used for both exports and imports, only requiring accurate json schemas to provide correct json output.

This is version allow configuration to connect to a mongo database and geoportal repository.
